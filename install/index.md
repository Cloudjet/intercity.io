<h1 class="m-t-0">Installing Intercity</h1>

You can install the latest version of Intercity on your (cloud) server
with a single-command installer script. This is the officially supported way
of installing Intercity.

The installer script downloads and configures Intercity for first use. After
installing via the script, you can perform initial setup steps in the web
interface of your own Intercity installation.

To install Intercity on your server, just SSH into your server as a root user
and execute the following command:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intercity/intercity-server/master/scripts/installer | bash
```
