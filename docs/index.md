<h1 class="m-t-0">Introduction to Intercity</h1>

Intercity is a hosting management dashboard that lets you manage (cloud) servers and deploy Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js and PHP apps.

Unlike a Platform as a Service (like [Heroku](https://heroku.com)), you install an Intercity instance on a seperate server. You then use that Intercity instance to configure and deploy apps on other servers in your infrastructure. This means that a simple setup always consists of at least two servers: one runs your Intercity instance and one or more other servers host your apps.

## Next steps

Ready to get started with Intercity? Start on the [Install Intercity](/docs/install.html) page. If you're interested in seeing how you use your own Intercity instance to deploy your apps, take a look at the [Install a server](/docs/install-server.html) page.
